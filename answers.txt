1. I prefer arbitrary number of arguments because I do not need to initialize an array and pass the array as argument.
2. Java is pass-by-value programming language.
3. jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD in main are references to objects. 
When we call swap(), we pass the values of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD references to parameters o1, o2. So o1 refers to jungleDVD object, o2 refers to cinderrellaDVD object. In swap method, we swap the values of o1, o2, so o1 will point to cinderellaDVD object and o2 will point to jungleDVD object. But o1, o2 are local to swap method, and the values of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD references in main are not changed. Therefore, the titles of 2 objects remain unchanged.
When we call changeTitle(), we pass the value of jungleDVD reference to parameter dvd, meaning that dvd points to jungleDVD object. In changeTitle method, we set the title of the object that dvd points to (jungleDVD object) to a new title. Therefore jungleDVD object will have the new title, and when we get the new title through jungleDVD reference in the main, we will see the change.
4. The return type of toString() is String.
